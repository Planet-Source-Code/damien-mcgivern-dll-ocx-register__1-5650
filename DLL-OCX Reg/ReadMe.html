face="Arial">Fisrt you have to create the file associations. This
would normally be done during the setup but as there isn't one
this is done by simply opening the .exe file. If the program isn't
opened by a dll or ocx file it registers the file associations.
This is handy as if you change the program's directory all you
need to do is open the program and the files are once again
associated with the program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"> Within the resource file are two icons ,101
= dll's 102 = ocx's . You can change these to what ever you wish
and recompile.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial">'Register' is the default
so to register a dll/ocx file simply double click on it's icon
and to unregister rigtht on the file and select 'Unregister' (left).</font></p>
